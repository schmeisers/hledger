hledger add-on commands, hledger-related scripts, developer builds.

Scripts named hledger-* are hledger add-on commands. The ones in this
bin/ directory are tested along with hledger, but shipped as add-ons
rather than built-in commands because they are experimental, or
for some other reason.

Add this directory to your $PATH and they will show up as commands
listed by hledger (or, you can run them directly).
To speed them up (recommended), compile them:

$ bin/compile.sh

When using hledger to run add-on commands, remember to use a --
before add-on-specific options or hledger will complain. Like so:

$ hledger [HLEDGEROPTS] ADDONCMD [-- ADDONOPTS]

See also http://hledger.org/hledger.html#add-on-commands .

hledger-related bash scripts, example make rules etc. are also kept here.
And hledger developer binaries may get stored here,
such as old versions for benchmarking, and platform-specific binaries.
