Snapshots of past versions of the web content.

At each major release, a new snapshot should be generated 
(with ./Shake site/doc/VERSION/.snapshot) and committed.

Major releases should also be added to the "available versions" links in site.js.

TODO: These were in this "doc/" subdirectory so that hakyll-std would see them, perhaps that's no longer necessary.
