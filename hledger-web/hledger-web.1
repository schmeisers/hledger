.PP
hledger\-web \- web interface for the hledger accounting tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]hledger\-web\ [OPTIONS]\f[]
.PD 0
.P

\f[C]hledger\ web\ \-\-\ [OPTIONS]\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hledger is a cross\-platform program for tracking money, time, or any
other commodity, using double\-entry accounting and a simple, editable
file format.
hledger is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1).
.PP
hledger\-web is hledger\[aq]s web interface.
It starts a simple web application for browsing and adding transactions,
and optionally opens it in a web browser window if possible.
It provides a more user\-friendly UI than the hledger CLI or hledger\-ui
interface, showing more at once (accounts, the current account register,
balance charts) and allowing history\-aware data entry, interactive
searching, and bookmarking.
.PP
hledger\-web also lets you share a ledger with multiple users, or even
the public web.
There is no access control, so if you need that you should put it behind
a suitable web proxy.
As a small protection against data loss when running an unprotected
instance, it writes a numbered backup of the main journal file (only ?)
on every edit.
.PP
Like hledger, it reads data from one or more files in hledger journal,
timeclock, timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]\-f\f[], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
For more about this see hledger(1), hledger_journal(5) etc.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Command\-line options and arguments may be used to set an initial filter
on the data.
These filter options are not shown in the web UI, but it will be applied
in addition to any search query entered there.
.PP
Note: if invoking hledger\-web as a hledger subcommand, write
\f[C]\-\-\f[] before options, as shown in the synopsis above.
.TP

.PP
A \@FILE argument will be expanded to the contents of FILE, which should
contain one command line option/argument per line.
(To prevent this, insert a \f[C]\-\-\f[] argument before.)
.PP
By default, hledger\-web starts the web app in "transient mode" and also
opens it in your default web browser if possible.
In this mode the web app will keep running for as long as you have it
open in a browser window, and will exit after two minutes of inactivity
(no requests and no browser windows viewing it).
With \f[C]\-\-serve\f[], it just runs the web app without exiting, and
logs requests to the console.
.PP
By default the server listens on IP address 127.0.0.1, accessible only
to local requests.
You can use \f[C]\-\-host\f[] to change this, eg
\f[C]\-\-host\ 0.0.0.0\f[] to listen on all configured addresses.
.PP
Similarly, use \f[C]\-\-port\f[] to set a TCP port other than 5000, eg
if you are running multiple hledger\-web instances.
.PP
You can use \f[C]\-\-base\-url\f[] to change the protocol, hostname,
port and path that appear in hyperlinks, useful eg for integrating
hledger\-web within a larger website.
The default is \f[C]http://HOST:PORT/\f[] using the server\[aq]s
configured host address and TCP port (or \f[C]http://HOST\f[] if PORT is
80).
.PP
With \f[C]\-\-file\-url\f[] you can set a different base url for static
files, eg for better caching or cookie\-less serving on high performance
websites.
.SH PERMISSIONS
.PP
By default, hledger\-web allows anyone who can reach it to view the
journal and to add new transactions, but not to change existing data.
.PP
You can restrict who can reach it by
.IP \[bu] 2
setting the IP address it listens on (see \f[C]\-\-host\f[] above).
By default it listens on 127.0.0.1, accessible to all users on the local
machine.
.IP \[bu] 2
putting it behind an authenticating proxy, using eg apache or nginx
.IP \[bu] 2
custom firewall rules
.PP
You can restrict what the users who reach it can do, by
.IP \[bu] 2
using the \f[C]\-\-capabilities=CAP[,CAP..]\f[] flag when you start it,
enabling one or more of the following capabilities.
The default value is \f[C]view,add\f[]:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]view\f[] \- allows viewing the journal file and all included files
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]add\f[] \- allows adding new transactions to the main journal file
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]manage\f[] \- allows editing, uploading or downloading the main or
included files
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
using the \f[C]\-\-capabilities\-header=HTTPHEADER\f[] flag to specify a
HTTP header from which it will read capabilities to enable.
hledger\-web on Sandstorm uses the X\-Sandstorm\-Permissions header to
integrate with Sandstorm\[aq]s permissions.
This is disabled by default.
.SH EDITING, UPLOADING, DOWNLOADING
.PP
If you enable the \f[C]manage\f[] capability mentioned above, you\[aq]ll
see a new "spanner" button to the right of the search form.
Clicking this will let you edit, upload, or download the journal file or
any files it includes.
.PP
Note, unlike any other hledger command, in this mode you (or any
visitor) can alter or wipe the data files.
.PP
Normally whenever a file is changed in this way, hledger\-web saves a
numbered backup (assuming file permissions allow it, the disk is not
full, etc.) hledger\-web is not aware of version control systems,
currently; if you use one, you\[aq]ll have to arrange to commit the
changes yourself (eg with a cron job or a file watcher like entr).
.PP
Changes which would leave the journal file(s) unparseable or non\-valid
(eg with failing balance assertions) are prevented.
(Probably.
This needs re\-testing.)
.SH RELOADING
.PP
hledger\-web detects changes made to the files by other means (eg if you
edit it directly, outside of hledger\-web), and it will show the new
data when you reload the page or navigate to a new page.
If a change makes a file unparseable, hledger\-web will display an error
message until the file has been fixed.
.SH JSON API
.PP
In addition to the web UI, hledger\-web provides some JSON API routes.
These are similar to the API provided by the hledger\-api tool, but it
may be convenient to have them in hledger\-web also.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/accountnames
/transactions
/prices
/commodities
/accounts
/accounttransactions/#AccountName
\f[]
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\f[B]LEDGER_FILE\f[] The journal file path when not specified with
\f[C]\-f\f[].
Default: \f[C]~/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows, perhaps
\f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
.SH FILES
.PP
Reads data from one or more files in hledger journal, timeclock,
timedot, or CSV format specified with \f[C]\-f\f[], or
\f[C]$LEDGER_FILE\f[], or \f[C]$HOME/.hledger.journal\f[] (on windows,
perhaps \f[C]C:/Users/USER/.hledger.journal\f[]).
.SH BUGS
.PP
The need to precede options with \f[C]\-\-\f[] when invoked from hledger
is awkward.
.PP
\f[C]\-f\-\f[] doesn\[aq]t work (hledger\-web can\[aq]t read from
stdin).
.PP
Query arguments and some hledger options are ignored.
.PP
Does not work in text\-mode browsers.
.PP
Does not work well on small screens.
